The Vibration and Acoustics Engineering Laboratory (VAEL) is located in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology and led by Prof. Christopher Sugino. We study how to control and leverage the flow of mechanical energy for a broad range of engineering applications.

Acoustic and elastic waves are the transient transfer of mechanical energy, making them relevant to nearly all physical systems. They enable verbal communication and understanding, allow us to see and communicate underwater, and they transfer stress, strain, and motion between points, affecting the design of engineering structures. Increasingly, acoustic waves are used in the form of ultrasound for non-destructive testing, biomedical imaging and therapy, and surface-acoustic wave devices. In all of these examples, the ability to control acoustic waves has had broad societal impact, such as the creation of non-invasive ultrasonic therapies for essential tremor and Parkinson's, better classroom design for learning in hearing-impaired children, and improved safety & reliability in wind turbines, aircraft, and other structures. 

**Thus, it is our group's objective to develop new, more precise, and more comprehensive ways to manipulate acoustic waves.**

## openings

We are looking for motivated students interested in vibration and acoustics research. Background in vibration, acoustics, mechatronics, control theory, or electrical engineering is a plus. If you are interested in joining our group, please email your resume/CV to Prof. Christopher Sugino. Prospective graduate students should follow Stevens' application process, requirements, and deadlines at the [graduate admission webpage](https://www.stevens.edu/admission-aid/graduate-admissions).
